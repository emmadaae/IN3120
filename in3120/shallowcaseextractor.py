class ShallowCaseExtractor:
    """
    Extracts strings from a buffer that are likely to be proper nouns of some kind: Names of people,
    locations, movies, whatever. The extraction is shallow and purely based on syntax cues in the form
    of case and punctuation: Strings that are capitalized are likely to be proper nouns, unless they start
    a new sentence. The extraction heuristic is slightly more refined than that, but not much.

    This is a sensible heuristic for many Western languages, except possibly German. Since the extraction
    is fundamentally based on case heuristics, applying it to text that has been case-normalized will result
    in zero matches. Applying it to languages that do not use whitespace to separate words, or applying it to
    languages that use case-less alphabets, will also not result in any matches.

    Buffers to be processed are assumed to be plain text, void of any markup. All markup such as HTML is assumed
    stripped away externally before this extraction heuristic is applied.
